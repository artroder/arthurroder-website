  <!-- HOW I WORK -->
  <section class="section">
    <h2 id="How-I-Work">How I Work</h2>
    <p class="section-intro">I work with companies that want SEO to be a reliable growth channel, not a collection of disconnected tactics. My approach is structured, data-driven, and focused on outcomes that matter to the business.</p>
    
    <div class="how-step">
      <img src="/img/mockup-icon.svg" alt="Mockup icon" aria-hidden="true">
      <div class="how-step-content">
        <h3>Strategy before tactics</h3>
        <p>Every engagement starts with understanding the business model, growth goals, and constraints. I don’t apply frameworks blindly, I rather prioritize opportunities based on impact, effort, and relevance to your stage.</p>

        <h3>Execution-first, no silos</h3>
        <p>I don’t deliver generic audits or decks that sit untouched. I analyze, implement, test, and iterate — working directly with content, code, and data to turn insights into measurable progress.</p>

        <h3>SEO as part of the conversion funnel</h3>
        <p>I treat SEO as part of a broader growth system in your project. That means aligning search demand with content, UX, conversion paths, and retention, not just rankings or traffic volume.</p>

        <h3>Decisions backed by real data</h3>
        <p>I leverage data from Google Search Console, Analytics, and custom analysis to guide priorities. Every recommendation is tied to evidence, not assumptions or best practices in isolation.</p>

  <!-- WHO I AM -->
  <h2 id="Who-I-Am">Who I Am</h2>
  <p>I started my career working hands-on with content — writing, translating, and optimizing pages — and moved naturally into strategic roles as I gained a deeper understanding of how search, content, and data connect. That progression shaped how I work today: SEO is most effective when it’s grounded in execution and tied directly to business goals.</p>
  <p>I’m an autonomous, methodical professional who’s comfortable owning projects end-to-end. I rely on structured processes and clear priorities, but I leave room to adapt as data, markets, and opportunities change. This allows me to work independently while collaborating closely with founders, marketers, developers, and content teams.</p>
  <p>I’m deeply interested in how search evolves and how technology shapes the way people discover information. I stay close to changes in search behavior and emerging tools — especially around data and AI — to ensure strategies remain relevant, sustainable, and focused on long-term growth rather than short-term wins.</p>
